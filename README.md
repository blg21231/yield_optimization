Yield Optimization for farms using Machine Learning

1. Generate sample time series training data

2. Train model to predict yield at Day = 100

3. Build optimization model to simulate all possible increases/decreases across combinations of all input features. Output yield optimization recommendation as a table of increase/decrease suggestsions and magnitudes for each input feature
